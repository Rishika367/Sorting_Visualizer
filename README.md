# Sorting_Visualizer

This web application provides an interactive visualization of six fundamental sorting algorithms. It allows users to observe the step-by-step execution of each algorithm through color-coded animations, with control over the speed of visualization, data size, and random data generation.

Implemented algorithms:
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort

Features:
1. Interactive Visualizations
Each algorithm's execution is visually represented, with color codes indicating different stages of sorting:

-Blue: Default state of the element.
-Yellow: Elements being compared.
-Red: Elements identified as in an incorrect position and marked for movement.
-Green: Elements that have been sorted and are in their correct position.

2. Controls for Customizing the Visualization
You can control various aspects of the sorting process using the following options:

-Speed Control: Adjust the speed of the visualization. There are 5 speed levels, ranging from slow to fast.
-Data Size Control: Choose the size of the data set to visualize (i.e., the number of elements in the array).
-New Data Generation: Randomly generate a new set of data for visualization.

3. Time and Space Complexity
For each algorithm being visualized, the application displays the time complexity and space complexity.
