# Sorting Visualizer

This web application provides an interactive visualization of six fundamental sorting algorithms. It allows users to observe the step-by-step execution of each algorithm through color-coded animations, with control over the speed of visualization, data size, and random data generation.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**

## Features

### 1. Interactive Visualizations

Each algorithm's execution is visually represented, with color codes indicating different stages of sorting:

- **Blue**: Default state of the element.
- **Yellow**: Elements being compared.
- **Red**: Elements identified as in an incorrect position and marked for movement.
- **Green**: Elements that have been sorted and are in their correct position.

### 2. Controls for Customizing the Visualization

You can control various aspects of the sorting process using the following options:

- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the visualization. There are 5 speed levels, ranging from slow to fast.
- **Data Size Control**: Choose the size of the data set to visualize (i.e., the number of elements in the array).
- **New Data Generation**: Randomly generate a new set of data for visualization.

### 3. Time and Space Complexity

For each algorithm being visualized, the application displays the time complexity and space complexity in Big-O notation.
